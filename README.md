*The extension of this work is released as [DRCDNet](https://github.com/hongwang01/DRCDNet) where we propose a dynamic rain kernel inference mechanism.

*This is a simple coding framework, which has better compatibility with running environments. The original coding framework for RCDNet CVPR2020 is released at https://github.com/hongwang01/RCDNet
